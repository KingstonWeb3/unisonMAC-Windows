**BIOMETRIC**
You should also update your Info.plist file in your iOS project to add a description for FaceID usage. This is a requirement from Apple to inform the user why the app needs FaceID access. 
<key>NSFaceIDUsageDescription</key>
<string>Why we need access to FaceID</string>

Storing Data: The actual biometric data never leaves the device and is securely stored in a secure enclave.
